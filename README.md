## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project was to edit the HTML and CSS without changing the content of the page. In addition to much superfluous code, there were other things that needed editing for future use.

This includes the rampant use of "div" as opposed to using semantic elements. The changing to the proper semantics was the primary challenge of this project.
